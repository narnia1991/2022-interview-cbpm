Build a simple blog. The app will allow a user to:
X Create a new post
X Update a post
X Delete a post

- View a single post
  X View all posts (with pagination)
- Search for posts via keyword, results must be paginated.
- Sort posts via date created / title
  -X via date created
  -- via title
  X At minimum, a post has a title and content.
  X Validations must be present (like post title and content should be required.)
  X Before deleting a post, a confirm modal should be displayed to warn the user, and ask if he/she wants to continue.
  X No need for user registration/login.

Tech Requirements:

1. Must use React and its hooks.
2. Use whatever you prefer for styling, UI frameworks, storage, etc.
3. Push the project to github.
